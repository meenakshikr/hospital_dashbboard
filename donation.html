                <h3>Why Organ Donation Matters</h3>
                <p>
                    India faces a severe shortage of organs. Thousands of patients suffer each year due to a lack of available donors.<br>
                    With a single decision, you can bring hope and save lives. <br>
                </p>

                <h3>The Situation in India</h3>
                Kidney failure affects 1.8 lakh people annually, yet only 6,000 transplants are performed. <br>
                Similarly, liver failure causes 2 lakh deaths, but only 1,500 liver transplants are done. You have the power to change this.

            <div><h3>The Chain of Life</h3>In a remarkable display of compassion, a chain of organ donations was sparked by a single act of generosity. When a young man named David tragically passed away, his family decided to donate his organs. This decision not only saved multiple lives but also initiated a domino effect. One of the recipients, a woman named Sarah, was so moved by the gift she received that she, in turn, donated a kidney to a stranger. This selfless act continued, creating a beautiful chain of giving that touched countless lives.</div>
            <div><h3>A Second Chance for a Child</h3>A young girl named Emma was diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder that required a liver transplant. Her family was devastated by the news but remained hopeful. Fortunately, a perfect match was found in a donor who had recently passed away. The transplant was a success, and Emma was able to live a normal, healthy life. Her story serves as a powerful reminder of the life-saving potential of organ donation, especially for children.</div>
            <div><h3>A Family's Legacy of Love</h3>A family from a small town experienced a profound loss when their son, a promising athlete, was killed in a car accident. Overwhelmed with grief, they decided to honor his memory by donating his organs. To their surprise, they discovered that their son's generosity had a far-reaching impact. His heart went to a young mother of two, his lungs to a child with cystic fibrosis, and his kidneys to two people in need. The family found solace in knowing that their son's legacy would live on in the lives of others.</div>
